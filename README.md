# To-Do App

A simple and interactive To-Do app where users can add tasks they need to complete. As tasks are completed, users can click on the task to mark it as done, and it will be struck through and moved to the bottom of the list. The footer displays the number of completed and total tasks to give a quick overview of your progress.
